# Project Management App

Welcome to the Project Management App, a simple yet powerful application for managing projects and clients. This app is built using Express.js for the server, GraphQL for querying and updating data, and React for the frontend. It leverages Apollo Client for seamless communication with the GraphQL server and React Router for smooth navigation between different views.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, enabling clients to request only the data they need.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, making it easy to develop interactive and dynamic frontend applications.
- **Apollo Client**: A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that connects a React application to a GraphQL server.
- **React Router DOM**: A standard library for routing in React applications, allowing for easy navigation between different views.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
